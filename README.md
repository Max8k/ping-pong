Ping-Pong Code for Discord.js v13


This code is designed to add a fun ping-pong feature to your discord.js v13 discord bot. Some of the features are that users get temporarily banned if they spam !ping, user ban data gets stored in a seperate JSON file, meaning that the bot still has all the ban info even if it restarts, and also the fact that you can specify which discord channel you want !ping to be in.
